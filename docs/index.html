  <h1>Biddlr</h1>
  <p>Biddlr is an application designed with the purpose of creating a marketplace of jobs involving unskilled labor, and providing the lowest price possible for job posters. Job posters can set a maximum price for their jobs before the bidding process begins, and watch the price go down as bidders compete to win the project. Job posters can choose not to accept the lowest bid and instead
go with any other of the bids for their job should they choose. Our application aims to create opportunities to build work credibility for non-professionals, and to help communities service each otherâ€™s needs in a way that provides value for everyone involved.
